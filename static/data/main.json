As you lift them from their watery caskets, some of them come apart in your hands, turning to valueless mush.","\n","^There are a few that can be salvaged – those that were protected from the moisture by virtue of being tucked beneath a dozen soggier books, a couple in watertight bags, some with laminated pages.","\n","^But in all of them, the crinkled pages are filled with runes and symbols you don't recognise.

It’s an unstable formation at first, but the energy starts to converge on a particular permutation.","\n","^Starting from below the water and moving upwards, the energy gradually condenses.
